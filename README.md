### PROJECT TITTLE : E-COMMERCE SALES ANALYSIS
---

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
---
This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data on revenue generated from product sales across various regions. 
The goal was to uncover key insights by identifying the top and bottom 5 regions by total revenue and summarizing the total revenue generated from all products sold.
To achieve this, I used pivot tables, bar charts, and pie charts to present the findings in a clear and visually engaging way.

 ### DATA SOURCES
 ---
The primary source of data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle, FRED, or any other data repository site.

### Data Cleaning  and Preparation 

To get the most out of my analysis, I first focused on cleaning and preparing the data to ensure it was reliable. Here’s what I did:

Handling Missing Data:
I spotted some missing values, so I filled in gaps where I could or removed the incomplete entries to keep the data reliable.

Fixing Inconsistencies:
There were a few inconsistencies like duplicate records and formatting issues, so I cleaned those up to make sure everything was accurate and made sense.

Standardizing Formats:
I made sure all the data was in a consistent format, especially for things like dates, revenue numbers, and product categories, so it would be easier to analyze later on.

With this cleaning process, I ensured the data was in good shape and ready for deeper analysis.

### Exploratory  Data Analysis 
----
Before diving into the analysis, I took time to explore the dataset and get a feel for the data. Here’s a quick look at what I did:
  -  What are the overall sales trends?
      I analyzed the revenue data to identify trends in sales across different regions and time periods, giving a clear picture of how sales have been performing overall.

 -  Which regions are the top performers?
      By breaking down revenue by region, I identified the top 5 and bottom 5 regions, highlighting areas with the strongest and weakest sales.

-  Which products contribute the most to total revenue?
      I examined product sales to determine which products were driving the majority of the revenue, focusing on those that consistently performed well.
